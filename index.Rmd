Hello and welcome!

This website gathers all the materials for the paper *Improving the Design Stage of Air Pollution Studies Based On Wind Patterns* by [Léo Zabrocki](https://lzabrocki.github.io/), [Anna Alari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MiFY320AAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Tarik Benmarhnia](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/tarik.benmarhnia).

To illustrate how our approach works, we study the effect of North-East winds on particulate matter concentrations in Paris over the 2008-2018 period. We were not allowed to share weather data from Météo-France so we added some noise to the weather parameters.

The website is structured as follows:

* A PDF version of preprint of the article is accessible through the <span style="color:#0471a6">Article</span>.
* The <span style="color:#0471a6">Data</span> tab describes the data wrangling procedure. It also contains a detailed exploratory data analysis.
* The <span style="color:#0471a6">Matching Analysis</span> tab presents all steps to implement the matching procedure, check covariates balance, analyse the matched data and carry out robustness checks.
* The GitHub directory contains the R codes to reproduce all results of the article.
